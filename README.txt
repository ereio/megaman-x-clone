Project Description: In this project I have attempted to recreate as much as I could of the first level of Mega Man X.
Players can destroy randomly spawned enemies and walk to the edge of the level. Health is at 8 hits but a bar is provided.
Players should expand their gameview as too small a field of view and you will see past the cameras allowance.

Player Controls:
Space - Shoot
Space(Held for 1.5seconds) - Charged Shot
WAD && Up,Left, and Right arrows - movement
